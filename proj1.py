#Part 2 (2.5 marks)
#boolean_query
#Write a program that performs boolean queries on the index.

#The command line arguments should be the path to the index followed by a boolean query
#Usage:
#~>./boolean_query [index file location] [query]
#Queries consist of:
#single terms
#phrases, consisting of two or more terms enclosed in double quotes (")
#Boolean expressions involving terms, phrases, or sub-queries connected with AND, OR and NOT operators
#Sub-queries are Boolean expressions enclosed in parenthesis (()
#Operator precedence should be handled as described here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_connective
#Your program should print the id of each document that satisfies the query, with one id per line.
#The order of the documents ids in the answer is not important for boolean queries.
#If an ill-defined query is provided (e.g., term AND) your program should print an error message and no other output.
#For example, the query dictionary AND love should return documents 101 and 1712 (each on a different line) while the query (dictionary AND love) OR ("harry potter" AND azkaban) should return documents 101, 690, 692, 694, and 1712.


#Part 4 (2.5 marks)
#zone_scoring
#Write a program that does weighted zone scoring (Chapter 6) and returns the document ids of the top k documents ranked according to equation 6.2 for a Boolean query q, provided as a command line argument.

#Queries should be as in Part 2 above. (Hint: reuse your code!)

#Usage and Parameters:

#./create_zone_index [document dir] [index dir]
#./zone_scorer [index dir] [k] [g] [q]
#All parameters are required. Your create_zone_index program will not be graded, but must be submitted.

#Note that the query may span multiple command line arguments. Hint: form the query by concatenating in a single string all command line arguments to the program, after the parameter g, adding white spaces between tokens.

#Note also that you are not asked to learn the optimal value of g. Assume it is a real number between 0 and 1.

#Output:

#doc_id1 score_1
#doc_id2 score_2
#...
#doc_idk score_k
#Where score_1 >= score_2 >= â€¦ >= score_k

#There should be two zones: title and body. The body is the content of the file, while the title is encoded in the file name. IMPORTANT: when tokenizing the titles, make sure to separate words connected by _ (e.g., 101_Dalmatians_1996 is tokenized into 101 Dalmatians and 1996).
